# Joust-CS152B
This was a class project in which we recreated the game Joust on FPGA. 

The main code can be found in tft-test/src/tft-demo.c

This is actually not the final product that was turned in for the class; it's essentially
a prototype that we made in the first few days (i.e. sans audio and input). We didn't want 
to help other students cheat by posting the complete code on GitHub.
